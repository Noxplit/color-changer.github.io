This application is used to select a color palette in hex format. 
Here you can choose any color for every taste and use it in your project!

The lock allows you to fix the selected color and continue searching for other colors.

To change the color in the desktop version, use the [space-key], and for the mobile version, the [Change-Color] button.

Happy using!
